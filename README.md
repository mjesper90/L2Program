# Start here

You will as a student be placed on top of many layers of software developed over the last hundred years
and as such much complexity will be abstracted away via modern languages and frameworks. We will use this to focus on understanding key aspects of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
You will come to use C# as your language to interact with the Unity game engine through assignments that will be delivered on Github via GitKraken.

So what did that all mean? If you follow below guide, you will come to know, I promise!
